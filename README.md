# SPV3 Known Issues
This is a dummy repository for keeping track of known SPV3 bugs. The bugs listed here are likely unfixable for one reason or another.

Currently, the phrase "unfixable bugs" refers to...
- stretched/skewed textures on level geometry
- Gameplay features crippled by engine and script limitations
- Corpses and weapons disappearing close to the player
- Disappearing particles and decals which include visual effects from shooting and explosions.
and others.

Most troubleshooting workaround are in their respective [Issues](https://github.com/HaloSPV3/SPV3-Known-Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue).
