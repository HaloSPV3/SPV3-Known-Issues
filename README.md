# SPV3-bugshit
This is a dummy repository for keeping track of known SPV3 bugs. The bugs listed here are likely unfixable for one reason or another.

Currently, the phrase "unfixable bugs" refers to...
...stretched/skewed textures on level geometry
...Gameplay features crippled by engine and script limitations
...Corpses and weapons disappearing close to the player
...Disappearing particles and decals which include visual effects from shooting and explosions.


Somewhat related issues such as mapping Start/Pause to a controller may also be listed for convenience.
